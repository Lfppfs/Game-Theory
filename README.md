This repo contains a Python code for setting up and performing analytical and numerical solutions in Game Theory models.

Game Theory (GT) is a framework developed primarily in Economics to model human interactions. It is based on the concept of a game: an interaction between two (or more) players (or economic agents), that can make decisions that will determine their course of action. Their decisions will ultimately determine their payoffs, i.e., how much they get (or lose) from their interaction. Game Theory is also used to model phenomena in other sciences apart from Economics, such as Biology, Computer Science and others.

The .py file has a sample code containing the classes and functions and quick examples of their usage; the Jupyter notebook has a more detailed explanation of their utilities, a quite brief Introduction to modelling a simple Game Theory system, and a more complex model from a scientific paper.
